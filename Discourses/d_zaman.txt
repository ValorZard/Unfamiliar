> What's your name, kid?
< Cosmo.
> Ah. Your witch picked a nice name for you.
> I'm Zaman. Nice to meet you, Cosmo.
< ...
> So... what did you say you forgot about?
< Communion Day.
> Communion Day...
> I don't know that much about witches. Is that a day that they celebrate?
< Yes. Witches and their familiars.
@< idle
< It's sort of an anniversary. It's the day a witch created their familiar.
< Like I said, she created me twelve years ago today.
> Really? You don't look twelve.
< We don't age like humans. It's complicated.
> Oh. okay.
> So, what happens on on Communion Day?
> Is it sort of like a birthday?
< No.
< There's a tradition for it that most witches follow.
@< explain
< It's supposed to be a celebration of the bond between a witch and their familiar.
< It's always started by the familiar.
< The familiar gives a gift to their witch.
@< idle
< It doesn't have to be anything special. Just a little token of gratitude.
< It's to show their witch thanks for summoning them into this world and granting them life.
< Then the witch gives their familiar a gift, too.
< It's to say thanks to their familiar for serving them and being their companion.
@< sad
< Then they spend the rest of the day doing their favorite activities together.
< The witch isn't supposed to give their familiar any orders throughout the day.
< It's a way of representing that, even though we serve our witches, we aren't any less than them.
@< idle
< We're a part of each other. We need each other.
> That's... really wonderful.
@< sad
< Yeah. Not all witches practice Communion Day, though.
< And, of course... you can't practice Communion Day if the familiar doesn't acknowledge it.
> The witch can't remind them, or anything?
< Nope. That's part of the tradition.
< And I ruined it. I forgot.
< I've ruined it multiple times.
< I'm such an awful familiar.
> Cosmo... Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone forgets things.
> It's not the end of the world.
@< angry2
< Yes it $sIS!
< You don't understand!
@< angry
< It's not like forgetting to wish someone a happy birthday, Zaman.
< If you're a familiar, forgetting to acknowledge Communion Day is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to your witch.
< It's like telling them that you don't appreciate them.
@< sad
< That your eternal contract and bond means nothing.
< And I forgot! $sAGAIN!
< I've forgotten so many times, and she's gotten so mad at me every time, and I $sSTILL $0managed to forget!
< $sWhat's wrong with me...?
< $sIt's bad enough that we got separated at the train station.
< $sNow we've missed Communion Day again.
< $sAnd it's all my fault.
> Wait... you two got separated?
< Yeah.
< The train was full. I had to wait for a later one.
< I looked for her all night. I looked all over the city.
< I never found her.
> Cosmo-
< Maybe she doesn't even want me to find her.
< I've forgotten so many times, she probably wants nothing to do with me anymore.
> Cosmo...
> It sure sounds to me like you appreciate your witch.
< Why?
> You've been searching for her all night.
> That sounds to me like you care.
@< angry
< I'm her familiar.
< I have to care about her. I'm bound to serve her for eternity.
> Are you saying you're only searching for her because you have to?
> If you weren't her familiar, would you even be looking for her?
> Is that the only reason you care?
@< angry2
< $sNO!
< Of $scourse $0it isn't!
>> Then why did you spend all night looking for her?

< I'm worried about her!
< Do you have any idea what people do to witches?

@< angry
< You should see what it's like back in Flagstaff.
< It happens practically every single time we leave the house.
< People treat her like trash. Just for being a witch.
< They treat me like trash, too, but that's beyond the point.
< Nothing too horrible has ever happened, but that's because we can protect each other.
@< sad
< Now she's alone. And neither of us have been to Los Muertos before.
< There could be people here who will kill her.
< And if that happens, I...

> You're not an awful familiar.

> And, I mean... she's a $wwitch. $0She can defend herself, right?
< Well... yeah.

< I have to apologize to her!
< I feel awful. I'm so stupid.
< I'm an idiot. Just like she always says.
< At some point she's going to stop forgiving me.
@< sad
< But I'm not letting myself not apologize.
< Even if she doesn't forgive me.
< Even if she hates me forever.
< I just want her to know I'm sorry.

> Cosmo, if you care this much about making things right, I don't think you're an awful familiar.
< There's no need to make things right if you don't screw them up in the first place.
> Cosmo, snap out of it!
< ...What?
> You forgot one day of the year. You made a human mistake.
@< sad
< I'm not-
> I know you aren't human. But you have a body and a soul, so I'm calling you human.
> Humans make mistakes. Your witch makes mistakes, too.
> If she doesn't accept your apology and hates you forever, that's her problem.
> Because, well... she's kind of stuck with you.
@< idle
> Tell her you're sorry, but don't let her knock you down for making a mistake.
@< sad
< ...
@< idle
< You're right.
< I'm stuck with her, and she's stuck with me. We can't stay mad at each other forever.
< We have to understand each other.
< It's like the pact said: we're a part of each other.
< I'm gonna go find her and tell her I'm sorry.
< And then I'll give her a hug.
< And if she doesn't hug me back... that's fine.
< I'll just hug her even harder.
