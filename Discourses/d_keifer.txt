< $wWell...
@> serious
@< idle
< This might take a bit of explanation.
< On how familiars are created, I mean.
@> idle
> I'm listening!
< Okay, so...
@< explain
< To create a familiar, you need three things.
@> serious
< First, you need to know the actual spell that does it.
< I think it draws energy from the underworld, or something.
> All right.
< When she created me, my witch had been practicing witchcraft for about fifteen years.
@< think
< And she says it took her about...

< Four months to learn the spell.

< It's $sreally $0complicated.
@> serious

@< idle
< Anyway.
@< explain
< Next, you need to actually give your familiar life.
< And you do that with a piece of your own soul.

> How do you even do that?

< You just tear out a piece of your own soul.

@< idle
< Yeah. My witch says it's... not pleasant.
@> serious
> ...
@< explain2
< And the last thing you need is a vessel.

< Some kind of object or memento to act as a host for the familiar.
@< idle
< The vessel you use determines the appearance and form your familiar will take.
> Oh... I see.
@< explain
< Yeah. If you use something like a pendant or trinket, they'll probably be a shapeless shadow.
@< idle
< But, in my case... my witch probably used a doll, or something. She hasn't actually told me.

> Can you make your cat your familiar, or something?
