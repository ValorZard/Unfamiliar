< I like cooking.
@< explain2
< I make dinner for my witch and me a lot of the time.
> Wow. That must be nice. I can't cook to save my life.
@< smile
> Who taught you?
< My witch. She's really good at cooking.
> What's her favorite thing to make?
< Gumbo. She has her own recipe.
> Wow, really?
> I didn't think people ate gumbo around here.
@< heh
< We're probably the exception and not the rule.
@< smile
> What about you? What's your favorite thing to cook?
@< explain2
< I have this really great stuffed pepper recipe.
@< satisfied
< My witch always says it's one of the best things she's ever eaten.
< Pretty impressive, right?
> Yeah.
@< smile
> ...
> Man, I wish I could cook...

< I play a few instruments.
> Really? Which ones?
< My favorite is my ocarina.
< I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.
> Huh... that's not an instrument you see every day.
> What else do you play?
@< explain2
< Mostly piano. We have one at home.
> Have you taken piano lessons?
< A few. I've also learned a bit from my witch.
> Nice.
> My mom wanted me to take piano lessons a while back.
> I was never that interested, though.
< I'm also in the process of learning flute.
@< heh
< I'm not very good, but I'm getting there.
> Man... you sound talented!
@< smile
> Your witch must be proud of you.
@< idle

< Yeah.

< I like to draw.
@< explain2
< I've been teaching myself in my spare time.
@< smile
> What do you like to draw?
@< heh
< ...Demons.
@< smile
< Not just demons that look like me, though. All different types.
< Demons from our world, demons from the underworld, demons that don't even exist...
< You get the idea.
@< explain2
< I also like drawing dragons and other monsters.
> I don't blame you. That kinda stuff is really cool.
> Besides, have you $wtried $0drawing a normal human? It's really hard.
@< heh
< Yeah... I've tried doing a few self-portraits. They didn't turn out well.
@< smile
> Is your witch into art at all?
< Not really. She's more of a music person. She plays piano.
> Oh, nice.
> So you've just been teaching yourself?
< Yeah. We have a few books laying around the house that talk about art.
> Well, if you ever get a chance to show me some of your art, I'd love to see it!
< Sure thing!

> Hey, Cosmo...
@< smile
< Yeah?
> I have a question.
@< idle
> You're a demon, but...
> Why do you look so much like a human?
@< think
< $wWell...
@< idle
< This might take a bit of explanation.
< On how familiars are created, I mean.
> I'm listening!
< Okay, so...
@< explain
< To create a familiar, you need three things.
< First, you need to know the actual spell that does it.
< I think it draws energy from the underworld, or something.
> All right.
< When she created me, my witch had been practicing witchcraft for about fifteen years.
@< smile
< And she says it took her...
@< heh
< Four months to learn the spell.
> What?!
< It's $sreally $0complicated.
> Yeah... must be.
@< idle
< Anyway.
@< explain
< Next, you need to actually give your familiar life.
< And you do that with a piece of your own soul.
> Your soul? You mean, like... give your familiar a piece of your soul?
> How do you even do that?
@< smile
< You just tear out a piece of your own soul.
> $sWhat?!
@< idle
< Yeah. My witch says it's... not pleasant.
> ...
@< explain2
< And the last thing you need is a vessel.
@< smile
< Some kind of object or memento to act as a host for the familiar.
@< idle
< The vessel you use determines the appearance and form your familiar will take.
> Oh... I see.
@< explain
< Yeah. If you use something like a pendant or trinket, they'll probably be a shapeless shadow.
@< idle
< But, in my case... my witch probably used a doll, or something. She hasn't actually told me.
@< smile
< So, that's why I look kinda like a human.
> That's pretty cool!
@< idle
> Can you make your cat your familiar, or something?
@< angry2
< $wNo!
@< idle
< The vessel you use has to be something without a soul.
@< explain
< Because you're giving part of your own soul to it to make it your familiar.
@< idle
> Okay. That makes sense.
> Sort of.
> Man, bein' a witch sounds $wcomplicated.
< Mhm.
< Being a familiar is even $wmore $0complicated.
> ...

> Cosmo, do you...
> ...
< Hm?
> Never mind.
< No, go ahead!
> ...
> Do you like being a demon?
< ...
@< smile
< I mean... yeah!
@< idle
< It's not always easy, though.
@< sad
< A lot of people don't like demons.
> What? Why?
< I don't know.
< They always call us "eldritch abominations."
> Man... why do people have to be like that?
> There's nothing wrong with demons.
@< smile
< I'm glad you think so.
@< explain2
< And being a demon $wdoes $0have its perks.
> I bet it does!
@< smile
>> What's your favorite part about being a demon?
[ Being able to use magic. (0, -60) R_2_1 | Being able to travel with my witch. (0, -60) R_2_2 | (uhh) (0, -60) R_2_3
--------------------
: R_2_1
< Being able to use magic.
> Oh, yeah! Demons can use magic.
@< explain2
< Yep. Humans have to become witches to use magic, but demons can use it naturally.
@< smile
< Although... you still have to learn how to use it. My witch taught me a long time ago.
> What type of magic do you use?
< Fire magic. The same as my witch.
> Oh.
> Isn't fire magic used for, like...
@< idle
> $wKilling people?
< I mean... you $wcould.
< If you wanted to be a horrible person and make everyone hate you.
@< explain2
< But fire magic also has a lot of more practical uses.
< Like, for example... imagine never having to buy a box of matches in your life.
< Need to light the fireplace? Just use fire magic.
< Birthday candles? Fire magic.
< Lost your flashlight? Make a flame in your hand and use it for light.
@< smile
> Huh... I never thought about it that way.
@< idle
< And... you can also use it for self-defense, of course.
@< sad
< I hope I never have to go that far.
< I've almost had to one or two times.
> Wow... so you must really have to keep control of your temper, huh?
@< idle
< I mean... not exactly?
@< explain
< It's not like our emotions correlate with our magic.
@< idle
< And I'd prefer to think I have enough control over myself to not just attack someone I'm mad at.
> Yeah. You're right.
> Sorry I made that assumption.
@< smile
< No worries.
