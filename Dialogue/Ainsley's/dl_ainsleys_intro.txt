Rhona: So, what are you doing here, Cosmo?
Cosmo: I don't know. I can't find my witch, and I'm not sure where to go.
Paul: Oh, you're a familiar?
Cosmo: Yeah. And my witch is...
...She's not going to be happy if I take too long to find her.
Paul: She'll definitely turn up. She's probably looking for you, too.

Rhona: You're stressing out too much.
You should take a break. Do something to take your mind off it.
Cosmo: ...Like what?
Rhona: Help us fix some stuff!
Cosmo: What?
Rhona: My grandpa repairs small trinkets.
I always help him with some of them when I come and visit, to make some money.
And... six hands are always better than four!
Cosmo: I, uh...
I'd probably be pretty hopeless at that.

Well... I do know a bit of magic...

And I'm sure if you helped out, Grandpa would give you some money, too!
Paul: I sure will!
Cosmo: Hm...
Rhona: Think about it, okay? Let us know if you want to give it a try!
