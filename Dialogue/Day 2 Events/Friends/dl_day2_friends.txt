Cosmo: Heh... hi.
Man: Are you-
Witch: Shhhh! Geoff, I told you.
You can't say a witch's name in front of their familiar.
Geoff: Right. My bad.
So he's her familiar?
Other Witch: They.
Geoff: Huh?
...
Oh. Sorry.
They're her familiar?
Other Witch: Yes.

Witch: It's been so long since we've seen her.
I don't think she even had you the last time.
She's told us a lot about you, though.
What was your name, again?

I'm Hildred.
Other Witch: Jay.
Geoff: Geoff.
Woman: Call me Kaz.
Third Witch: I'm Penelope.

Jay: Why don't you sit down, Cosmo?
We saved a seat for you and your witch.
Kaz: Where is she, anyway?
Cosmo: ...You haven't seen her yet?

Cosmo: ...
She must be running late.

Cosmo: So, what have I missed?
Penelope: Oh, not much. We've just been talking.
Esther is enjoying her first year of high school.
Cosmo: Oh, she just started high school? Neat!
Esther: Did you even go to high school?
Cosmo: ...No. My witch homeschooled me.
What grade are you in, Klaus?

Klaus: ...
Fourth.
Cosmo: Nice.

Kaz: You know... I'm getting a little tired of sitting around.
Penelope: Honestly, me too.
Should we take a walk around Los Muertos?
It's such a pretty city, and I'd like to see more of it.
Jay: I'm down.
Kaz: Sounds good!
