Witch: ...
Cosmo: ...
Witch: Can I HELP YOU, honeybucket?
Cosmo: Uh...
You're a witch, right?
Witch: ...
Don't I look like one, newt nose?
Everyone else knows I'm a witch. And I never hear the end of it.
I thought a demon would be able to figure it out instantly.
Cosmo: Sorry...
What's your name?
Witch: Yaga.
What do you want? I'm very busy.
Cosmo: Doing what?
Yaga: Waiting for my 'wich.
Cosmo: What?
Waiting for your witch?
Yaga: Yes! My 'wich! My sandwich?
Look at the stupid menu! It has a section right there that says "'wiches!"
Cosmo: Oh.
Didn't notice that.

Yaga: Why are you still here?
Cosmo: I'm sorry. I just wanted to ask you if-
Deli Clerk: NUMBER 26!
Yaga: Oh. Great. My order's ready.
This was a wonderful conversation, but I'm getting my 'wich now.

Yaga: Man... you're really persistent, kid.
Cosmo: ...
Have you seen my witch?
Yaga: Excuse me?
You ordered one too?
Cosmo: What?
...No. Not my sandwich. My witch... witch.
She's wearing a bright yellow coat.
If I don't find her soon, she'll be-
Yaga: Wait. You're a familiar?
What are you doing away from your witch, hamster hair?
That's the first rule familiars should know. Attend your witch at all times.
Your witch must be pretty stupid if she didn't tell you that.
Cosmo: She's not STUPID! I know I'm not supposed to be away from her!
I've been her familiar for over seven years!
We got separated because we had to get on different trains!

Yaga: Look, honeybucket. I don't have time to help you.
Cosmo: Why not?
Yaga: I'm busy, snake breath!
Cosmo: All you're doing is eating dinner!
Yaga: I haven't eaten all day, halibut head! Can't a witch enjoy something for once?
At least I'm not an inconsiderate demon jerk walking around and butting into
other people's conversations because he couldn't be bothered to stay with his witch!

Cosmo: It's "they."
That's the least you could get right if you're going to insult me.

Yaga: ...
Ugh...
Sorry.
I didn't mean to make you upset.
Cosmo: I'm sure you didn't.

Witch: OK, don't get snide on me, hamster hair.
Just tell me about your witch. I might be able to help.
This place's sandwiches are garbage, anyway. I can wait on eating dinner.
