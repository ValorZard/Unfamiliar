Witch: Can I HELP YOU, honeybucket?
Cosmo: Uh...
Cosmo: You're a witch, right?
Witch: ...
Witch: Don't I look like one, newt nose?
Witch: Everyone else knows I'm a witch. And I never hear the end of it.
Witch: I'd think a demon would figure it out.
Cosmo: Sorry...
Cosmo: What's your name?
Witch: Yaga.
Yaga: What do you want? I'm very busy.
Cosmo: Doing what?
Yaga: Waiting for my dinner.

Cosmo: ...
Cosmo: Have you seen my witch?
Yaga: Excuse me?
Cosmo: I don't know where she is.
Cosmo: If I don't find her soon, she'll be-
Yaga: Wait. You're a familiar?
Yaga: What are you doing away from your witch, hamster hair?
Yaga: That's one of the first rules familiars should know.
Yaga: Attend your witch at all times.
Yaga: Your witch must be pretty stupid if she didn't tell you that.

Cosmo: Why not?

Yaga: I said I'm busy, snake breath!
Cosmo: All you're doing is eating dinner!

Yaga: I haven't eaten all day, halibut head!
Yaga: Can't a witch enjoy something for once?

Yaga: Everyone always tries to drag me into something stupid!
Yaga: Well, guess what? I don't care about your stupid problems!
Yaga: If you need a shoulder to cry on, then find your damn witch!
Yaga: I've got much better things to do than help some demon jerk!
