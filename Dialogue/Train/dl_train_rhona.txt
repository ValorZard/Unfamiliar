Cosmo: Hi.
Commuter: What's wrong? You look kinda down.
Cosmo: ...
My witch and I got separated. We had to get on different trains.
Commuter: Your witch?
Does that mean you're a familiar?
Cosmo: Yes.
Commuter: Oh... do you need help finding her?
Cosmo: I don't think so. I can probably find her myself.
Commuter: ...
Well, before you leave, we should talk a bit!
Cosmo: What?
Commuter: I'm Rhona. What's your name?
Cosmo: Cosmo.
Rhona: Nice to meet you, Cosmo!

Cosmo: Why do you want to talk to me?
Rhona: Because you're a demon! Demons are cool!
Cosmo: ...You think so?
Most people call us eldritch abominations.
Rhona: Oh, brother...
You just look like a human with horns to me.
Cosmo: Yeah... I get that a lot.
Rhona: And I don't care if you're an "abomination."
You seem really nice. I want to learn more about you!
Cosmo: ...
I'm not very good at talking.
Rhona: Oh, don't worry.
I'll show you how it's done!
